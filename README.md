This is a basic react app which allows user to enter text and manipulate it and provide the following utilities:

1. To Uppercase : Converts the entered text to Uppercase
2. To Lowercase : Converts the entered text to Lowercase
3. Counts words
4. Counts characters

These are the few options I have added right now and will make add ons in the future based on recommendations and things I myself find.

Hope you enjoy my app!

Thank You
